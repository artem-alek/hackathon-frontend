# Hackathon-Frontend



This was a team based project where my teammate Ryan Jowers and I worked to build an Instagram like website in a Hackathon over the course of two and a half days. This was also our first shot at building and deploying a full site with both an integrated front and backend. We used Node.js, Express, and Sequelize for our backend and AngularJS for our frontend.


#### The Home Page

The first page of the website displays all of the the photos uploaded by our users. If you wish to take a closer look at an image, you may hover over an image and click the view icon. This will then take you to a new page with a larger picture of that image.

#### The Image Page

 Not only does this page allow you view a bigger image but also allows users to comment on the image and share their thoughts.

#### User Page

Users also have their own user page which displays all of their work. If you see a particular image you like and want to see more of what that user has uploaded, you can hover an image and click the user icon. This will then take you to their user page. Users can also upload a profile picture to their user page.

#### Sign Up

Signing up for our site is easy. Just click on the sign up/ sign in button at the top of the page and fill out the information.
